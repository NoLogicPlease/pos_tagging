    "But there is a very important caveat! As usual, the element of the test set must not influence the elements of the other splits!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you compute new embeddings for train+validation, you must forget about test documents.\n",
    "The motivation is to emulate a real-world scenario, where you select and train a model in the first stage, without knowing nothing about the testing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation convenience, you CAN use a single vocabulary file/matrix/whatever. The principle of the previous point is that the embeddings inside that file/matrix must be generated independently for train and test splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically in a real-world scenario, this is what would happen:\n",
    "1. Starting vocabulary V1 (in this assignment, GloVe vocabulary)\n",
    "2. Compute embeddings for terms out of vocabulary V1 (OOV1) of the training split \n",
    "3. Add embeddings to the vocabulary, so to obtain vocabulary V2=V1+OOV1\n",
    "4. Training of the model(s)\n",
    "5. Compute embeddings for terms OOV2 of the validation split \n",
    "6. Add embeddings to the vocabulary, so to obtain vocabulary V3=V1+OOV1+OOV2\n",
    "7. Validation of the model(s)\n",
    "8. Compute embeddings for terms OOV3 of the test split \n",
    "9. Add embeddings to the vocabulary, so to obtain vocabulary V4=V1+OOV1+OOV2+OOV3\n",
    "10. Testing of the final model\n",
